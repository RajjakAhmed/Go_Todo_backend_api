# Go Todo Backend API

This is a simple RESTful Todo Backend API built using Go and the Fiber framework.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

- REST API design
- Proper HTTP method usage
- JSON file persistence
- Business rule enforcement at application level
- Clean backend logic without frontend dependency

---

##  Core Features

• Add a new todo  
• Get all todos  
• Delete a todo  
• Mark a todo as completed  
• Live count endpoint (total / completed / pending)  
• Data persistence using JSON file  
• Constraint: Only one todo can be completed at a time  

---

##  Design Decisions

- Todos are stored in-memory using a slice.
- Data is persisted to a `todos.json` file after every modification.
- On server restart, data is loaded from the JSON file.
- Business constraint (single completed todo) is enforced inside the PATCH logic.
- Counts are calculated dynamically to ensure accuracy.

##  Tech Stack
